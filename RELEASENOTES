c4bc373 US1519: Cannot use helper.requirejs as in Play 2.3.x it does not seem to get the paths correct (it is assuming there is a minified folder, but there isn't and it does not minify the files itself)

f75443e US1519: re-write of require-js to dependency inject the modules. As you can only have one ref to require-js on a html page I moved main.js out of the govMainDefault and instead specify it on any page that needs it. Made a .js file just for the confirm page which pulls the required modules and the main.js into itself. I can't seem to find out a better way of passing in params so instead it reads the value of the radio button from the page
